KisanSaathi is an intelligent agricultural chatbot designed specifically for Indian farmers, combining cutting-edge AI technologies to provide comprehensive farming assistance in multiple Indian languages.

## 🚀 Problem Statement

Indian agriculture faces numerous challenges that hinder farmers' productivity and decision-making:

### Critical Challenges Farmers Face
